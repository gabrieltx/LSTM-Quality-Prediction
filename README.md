## ‚öôÔ∏è About

This project is an extract of a larger study that I developed as my final project for my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering. The main objective was to evaluate different machine learning techniques to predict a quality parameter of an industrial process. Among the techniques studied, the one with the best performance was the LSTM neural network, a model well known for its applications in time series forecasting.

The results obtained showed a good predictive capacity of the model, reaching an R2 of approximately 0.70 for the validation partition, coupled with a low RMSE for both training and testing. The complete story of the development of this project was published on Medium, available for access in the links section.
